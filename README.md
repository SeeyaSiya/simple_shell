The project is about creating a simple shell program in C language, which will be done in teams of two people named Siya and William. 
By the end of the project, the team is expected to have a good understanding of the Unix operating system, the Unix shell, the B programming language, 
the C programming language, and the concepts such as a pid, a ppid, a function, a system call, process creation, and PATH. The shell program should have the same output
and error output as the /bin/sh program and should not have any memory leaks. The project has specific requirements such as using allowed editors, compiling on Ubuntu 20.
04 LTS using gcc, using the Betty style, and following a specific set of system calls and functions. The project also requires creating specific files such as README.md, 
AUTHORS, main.h, main.c, prompt.c, special_character, string.c, cmd.c, and execute.c. The AUTHORS file will contain the list of individuals who contributed
to the repository, and a script is provided to generate this file automatically.
